## Overview

ValencyStudio - Spoofer connects directly to a running Roblox Studio session through a companion Luau plugin. Once connected, assets can be discovered, previewed, and replaced across the entire place without manually searching through instances or modifying place files.

</table>

ValencyStudio - Spoofer keeps the desktop application and Studio plugin synchronized so replacements can be applied while the place is running. The application handles discovery, previews, profiles, and replacement configuration while the plugin performs the Studio side operations.

## Installation

Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/valency-studio/valencystudio-spoofer/releases/latest).

| Platform | Package                                        |
